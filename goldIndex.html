        <p>trembling are the desert winds<br>as they sweep plaintively<br>from Indio to New Mexico<br>carrying with them tumbleweeds<br>birds of prey<br>and the ineffable life-force of the wide-open,<br>the quixotic in all of that grand nothingness.</p>
        <p>"baby," he said, "I'm gonna find me a life"<br>way out west."(1)<br>"do I pray?" "do I play?"(2) "away."</p>
        <p>intrepid, he set out in the footsteps of Machado<br>breaking dusty ground<br>tugging on bootstraps as he went<br>bearing chest, heart, and soul, to the wind<br>to the sun's implacable glower</p>
        <p>the sun, a glowing ornament<br>a fixture in the heavens<br>cracking the parched desert floor<br>(thirsty for at least a thousand years)<br>and his weathered lips and mind.</p>
        <p>when the rattler appeared on his third day<br>he gazed toward the distant horizon<br>and then at the mighty heavens above<br>dreaming of salty chicken noodle soup<br>the soft caress of his girl's bosom<br>a swig of Kentucky's finest, the nectar of beam<br>the whimsical notes of his banjo back home.</p>
        <p>his wistful longings were but fleeting<br>floating east absent a care<br>succumbing to a splash of the sublime<br>to the divine radiance of fire gracing the horizon,<br>exploding riotously, liberally, in beams<br>of orange, pink, crimson, and yellow</p>
        <p>a sublime shimmer of gold,<br>heralding the stars<br>inviting those brilliant bodies to twinkle<br>to dance playfully across the enveloping dark of night.</p>
        <p>solace, he found<br>solace, in the crackling of a campfire<br>an offering from those feisty tumbleweeds<br>a saving grace from moonlit shivers<br>from the intermittent chill of solitude</p>
        <p>and so he warmed his heart and his bones,<br>pioneering the extreme<br>and the extremes.</p>
